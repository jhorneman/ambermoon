ÝSTART  000     ORT
TARBOS COFFIN HALL
ÝEND..

ÝSTART  001     DOOR #31 SIGN OF AMBERSTAR
A 12-POINTED RECESS IS VISIBLE IN THE DOOR.
ÝEND..

ÝSTART  002     DOOR #31 OPEN
AS YOU INSERT THE AMBERSTAR INTO THE RECESS IT MELTS INTO THE DOOR WHICH
THEN OPENS.

ÝSTART  003     THORNAHUUN AWAKES
YOU DO NOT KNOW WHETHER YOU HAVE TRIGGERED AN INAUDIBLE MECHANISM - ANYWAY
THE GROUND BEGINS TO SHAKE. AS YOU MOVE CLOSE TO THE HUGE COFFIN, BUT
BEFORE YOU REACH IT, ITS LID CREAKS OPEN. ROOTED TO THE GROUND, YOU STAND
STILL AS IF FROZEN SOLID WHILE A GIGANTIC DEMON STRETCHES UP OUT OF THE COFFIN.
HE REACHES HIS FULL HEIGHT, LOOKS AROUND WITH FLASHING EYES AND THUNDERS
AT YOU IN A VOICE WHICH ALMOST BLASTS YOU AWAY:^
"AH, MORTALS! BE AFRAID, FOR TARBOS, THE GOD OF CHAOS, IS FREE AGAIN!"^
THEN HE LOOKS DOWN AND, WITH A CRY OF RAGE HE HOWLS:^
"AAARRGHH! WHY HAVE I BEEN SEPARATED FROM TAR?^
ITS YOUR FAULT, YOU MISERABLE PILES OF DUST! YOU WILL DIE FOR THIS, AND
RIGHT NOW, AS TRUE AS I AM THE KING OF HELL!"^
HE BREAKS INTO AN INCOMPREHENSIBLE ROARING AND, IN THE DEAFENING NOISE, 
~LEAD~ SHOUTS TO THE GROUP:^
"THAT IS THORNAHUUN! OUR ONLY CHANCE IS TO ATTACK IMMEDIATELY!"
ÝEND..

ÝSTOP.
